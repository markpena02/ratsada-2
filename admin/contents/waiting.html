During the internship program, the student interns are assigned to different areas and venues, while the Host Training Establishments (HTEs), the student interns are given actual work experience in various departments that may be determined and mutually agreed upon by the school, HTE, or the student intern. An internship contract is signed by the student intern, the Higher Education Institution (HEI), and the Host Training Establishment (HTE). This agreement identifies the student intern’s tasks and some policies regarding the program. This is a requirement for graduation as part of the curriculum design. Hence, this MOA is proposed to formalize the academe-industry collaboration.</td>
